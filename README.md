# Flash-Mintable ERC20 Token
Every nerd can be rich for an instance :nerd_face:

## Installation & dependencies
This repo uses the [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework, a Python-based development and testing framework for smart contracts targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

To install any dependencies, run the following command from the terminal: 

```brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@4.0.0```

## Flash-Mintable what?? :thinking:
Have a look at the medium [blog post]() for more information. 

## Bug Bounty!
At the current time of writing, this simple contract was not audited. Anyone who manages to exploit the contract, that is, anyone who manages somehow to mint more tokens than they have to burn at the end, will win USD as a bounty!
